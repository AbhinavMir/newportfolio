1. Do not lie - to yourself or others - unless it serves an altruist purpose.
2. Stand up straight, clean up yourself, clean up your room and drink a glass of water.
3. Build leverage - it can be built thru product, content, capital or network - usually they’re interconnected.
4. Renting out time (freelancing, job) won’t make you rich, but it’s an excellent way to accumulate capital, sometimes even network.
5. “Hell Yes or No” - focus on few things, but do them well.
6. Pareto’s principle + Aggregation of marginal returns.
7. Impatience with action, Patience with results.
8. A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought - they must be earned. (Addendum: Happiness is peace in motion)
9. You can never understand everything. But, you should push yourself to understand the system - Finance, Physics, Engineering, Psychology what have you.
10. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
